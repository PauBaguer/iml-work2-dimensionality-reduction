# TODO 

> We can change one dataset if we need to.

- [AGUS] Choose most informative features in datasets to plot original datasets
- [PAU] Implement own PCA
- [PAU] Analyze PCA in three datasets
- [CLAUDIA] Compare and analyze results with sklearn.decomposition.PCA and sklearn.decomposition.IncrementalPCA
- [AGUS] PCA to reduce dimensionality + cluster it with our k-Means and BIRCH from sklearn
- [LAIA] Use sklearn.decomposition.truncatedSVD to reduce dimensionality + cluster with our k-Means and BIRCH
- [CLAUDIA] Visualize P low-dimensional space. Compare with & without dimensionality reduction PCA & ISOMAP
